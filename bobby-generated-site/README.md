# Bobby's Cool App

This web app serves up a React app that says "Hello
React World!"

## Building the App

Run `yarn build`. This will use webpack to bundle the
website and code into a deployable web package.

We leverage `html-webpack-plugin` to serve up an HTML
page that will run our React app?

## Running the App

Run `yarn start`. This will use webpack-dev-server to
serve up the website.

## Testing the App

What are tests?
